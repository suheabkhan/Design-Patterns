1. Dominos pizza

- creates different varities of pizza and calculates cost depending on the ingredients used
-Example, wheat core, paneer and corn toppings will have a different cost as its a different variety

Decorator pattern is used, when the base object remains same even if new features are added on top of the base object.
Example:  wheat pizza base
          add jalapeno toppings to the above pizza. It's still a pizza with different toping
          add mushroom toppings to the above pizza. Now, again its a pizza

- There can be several varities of pizza with thin crust, wheat base, thick crust and other toppings combinations (paneer, mushroom,
chicken, tandoori, corn, jalapeno, cheese)
- Also, can be combinations of paneer+any one of them
- If we are interested in getting different combinations, then we need different classes with each combinations. If we go on doing that
then the the number of classes may go very high.(class explosion)

- Also the above design is not good, as if we want to add new toppings, then base pizza class gets changed. Therefore, it is like
open for modification. Violation of the open-closed principle
